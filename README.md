# 🚀 EchoFrame – Web-based Augmented Reality Experience

EchoFrame is a professional **WebAR (Web-based Augmented Reality)** project built using **MindAR**, designed to deliver immersive AR experiences directly through the browser — without requiring any mobile application.

## 🧠 What This Project Does

EchoFrame uses the device camera to recognize a predefined image target.
